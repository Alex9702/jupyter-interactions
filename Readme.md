# Jupyter Interactions repository

![](https://api.travis-ci.org/mikecroucher/jupyter-interactions.svg?branch=master)

This site was created to show off not only interesting maths, programming, and data science, but also the power of Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is a demonstration of a single concept and makes use of [ipywidgets](https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets) to generate an interactive mini-application within the Jupyter notebook.

## Contributing a notebook

To contribute a notebook to the collection, make sure that it follows the structure of the template laid out in [template.ipynb](./template.ipynb) and make a Pull Request. Your contribution will then be reviewed by members of the community.

## The Website

We have a prototype website for this project at https://mikecroucher.github.io/jupyter-interactions/.  This was built during a hackathon session at the [Computational Mathematics with Jupyter Workshop](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/) in early 2017. Code to generate the site is at https://github.com/christianp/jupyter-interactions-site
